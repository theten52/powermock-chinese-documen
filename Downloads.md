### Note on using 1.6.6 with Mockito ###
There was a problem with the release process which excluded files in the `powermock-api-mockito-common` module for the PowerMockito API. So if downloading any of the mockito zip files below make sure to also [download this file](http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/powermock/powermock-api-mockito-common/1.6.6/powermock-api-mockito-common-1.6.6.jar) and put it in your classpath.


## Legacy versions ##

You may find version from 1.5.4 to 1.6.6 at [Bintray](https://bintray.com/johanhaleby/generic/powermock).

There is no way to get legacy version any more. Legacy versions of PowerMock (version 1.5.3 and below) was hosted on Google Code service which unfortunately [was closed in 2016](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html).
